# Vibha
Choose one of the files to create(You don't have to add any of the functionalities i.e. making the login page work, we'll do that later. Just make the UI/layout for now):

 - Information Page
 - DFW Main Page - Ekansh Agrawal
 - Other Main Page
 - Other More Page
 - About Vibha Dallas Page - Aryan Gandhi

You can find details about each page here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yNAALrpz73bPMEkziucxcEo0harJcaQHBRzsftLWrzk/edit?usp=sharing

Once you choose a page to do, change this file(README.md), and add your name next to the page so no one else also works on it accidentally. 

Then make a branch and begin working on your changes! If you don't know how to make a branch, or how to use git/github, this might help: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdAHXoRtos
